This is a simple app that will display nearby pictures pulled from the Instagram API.  If location services are unavailable, it will simply fallback to displaying popular pictures.

Feel free to use and modify the code for any purposes you see fit.

Many thanks to Mattt Thompson and Scott Raymond for the wonderful @AFNetworking library!
